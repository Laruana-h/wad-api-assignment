If you have your API design on an online platform or graphic, please link to it (e.g. [Swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/api/Laruana-h/movies-api_documentation/1.0.0)).


## Security and Authentication
Give details of authentication/ security implemented on the API(e.g. passport/sessions). Indicate which routes are protected.
- session file:

~~~Javascript
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "ilikecake",
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: true,
  })
);
~~~

- authentication file:

~~~Javascript
const JWTStrategy = passportJWT.Strategy;
const ExtractJWT = passportJWT.ExtractJwt;
let jwtOptions = {};
jwtOptions.jwtFromRequest = ExtractJWT.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken();
jwtOptions.secretOrKey = process.env.SECRET;
const strategy = new JWTStrategy(jwtOptions, async (payload, next) => {
  const user = await UserModel.findByUserName(payload);
  if (user) {
    next(null, user);
  } else {
    next(null, false);
  }
});
passport.use(strategy);
~~~
- protected routeï¼š

~~~Javascript
app.use('/api/actors', passport.authenticate('jwt', {session: false}), actorsRouter);
app.use('/api/rate', passport.authenticate('jwt', {session: false}), rateRouter);
~~~

## Integrating with React App

Describe how you integrated your React app with the API. Perhaps link to the React App repo and give an example of an API call from React App. For example: 
- API call from React App

~~~Javascript
export const getMovies = () => {
  return fetch(
     '/api/movies',{headers: {
       'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
    }
  }
  )
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => {return json.results;});
};

export const getPopularActor = () => {
  return fetch(
     '/api/actors',{headers: {
       'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
    }
  }
  ).then(res => res.json());
  
  export const getUpcomingMovies = () => {
    return fetch(
      '/api/movies/tmdb/upcoming',{headers: {
        'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
     }
   }
    ).then(res => res.json());
  };
  

export const getNowplayingMovies = () => {
  return fetch(
    '/api/movies/tmdb/nowplaying',{headers: {
      'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
   }
 }
  ).then(res => res.json());
};
~~~
- login/sign up API
    can use mongoDB user login   
~~~Javascript
  export const login = (username, password) => {
    return fetch('/api/users', {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        method: 'post',
        body: JSON.stringify({ username: username, password: password })
    }).then(res => res.json())
};

export const signup = (username, password) => {
    return fetch('/api/users?action=register', {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        method: 'post',
        body: JSON.stringify({ username: username, password: password })
    }).then(res => res.json())
};
